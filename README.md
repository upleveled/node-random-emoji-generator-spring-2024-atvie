# Node Random Emoji Generator Spring 2024

Display a random emoji by running the application without any arguments:

```
node index.js
ðŸ¥¹
node index.js
ðŸ¦Š
```

Display a specific emoji by providing the emoji name as an argument:

```
node index.js smiley
ðŸ˜Š
```

Display an error message if the emoji name is incorrect:

```
node index.js UpLeveled
This emoji "UpLeveled" doesn't exist
```
